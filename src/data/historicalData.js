  'World War II': {
    narrative: `World War II (1939-1945) was the deadliest and most destructive war in history. The conflict began in Europe when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. This aggressive action prompted Britain and France to declare war on Germany, marking the beginning of World War II.

    The war soon expanded into a truly global conflict. In June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, breaking their non-aggression pact. The United States entered the war after Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The war in Europe ended with Germany's surrender in May 1945, and the war in the Pacific concluded with Japan's surrender in August 1945 following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

    The aftermath of World War II reshaped the political and social structure of the world. The United States and Soviet Union emerged as global superpowers, leading to the Cold War. The United Nations was established to maintain international peace, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in response to the war's atrocities.`,

  'Ancient Egypt': {
    narrative: `Ancient Egypt was one of the world's first and most long-lasting civilizations, spanning over 3,000 years from around 3100 BCE to 30 BCE. The civilization developed along the Nile River, whose annual flooding created fertile soil for agriculture, forming the backbone of the Egyptian economy and society.

    The ancient Egyptians made remarkable achievements in architecture, art, mathematics, medicine, and writing. They built massive monuments like the pyramids and temples that still stand today, developed a sophisticated writing system using hieroglyphs, and created innovative irrigation systems. Their religious beliefs, centered around many gods and the afterlife, heavily influenced their culture and daily life.

    Egyptian society was highly structured, with the pharaoh at the top as both political ruler and religious leader. The civilization went through several major periods, including the Old Kingdom (known for pyramid building), the Middle Kingdom (marked by cultural achievements), and the New Kingdom (the peak of Egyptian power and influence).`,
